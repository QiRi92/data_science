    "Indeed, there are two ways to define a model in PyTorch. The goal is to make it like a function that takes an input and returns an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model can be defined as a sequence of layers. You create a <code>Sequential</code> model with the layers listed out. The first thing you need to do to get this right is to ensure the first layer has the correct number of input features. In this example, you can specify the input dimension  8 for the eight input variables as one vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other parameters for a layer or how many layers you need for a model is not an easy question. You may use heuristics to help you design the model, or you can refer to other people’s designs in dealing with a similar problem. Often, the best neural network structure is found through a process of trial-and-error experimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure of the problem but small enough to make it fast. In this example, let’s use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers or dense layers are defined using the <code>Linear</code> class in PyTorch. It simply means an operation similar to matrix multiplication. You can specify the number of inputs as the first argument and the number of outputs as the second argument. The number of outputs is sometimes called the number of neurons or number of nodes in the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need an activation function <strong>after</strong> the layer. If not provided, you just take the output of the matrix multiplication to the next step, or sometimes you call it using linear activation, hence the name of the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use the rectified linear unit activation function, referred to as ReLU, on the first two layers and the sigmoid function in the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sigmoid on the output layer ensures the output is between 0 and 1, which is easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class by a cut-off threshold of 0.5. In the past, you might have used sigmoid and tanh activation functions for all layers, but it turns out that sigmoid activation can lead to the problem of vanishing gradient in deep neural networks, and ReLU activation is found to provide better performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can piece it all together by adding each layer such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model expects rows of data with 8 variables (the first argument at the first layer set to 8)\n",
    "- The first hidden layer has 12 neurons, followed by a ReLU activation function\n",

    "This code uses a different way of building the model but should functionally be the same as before. After the model is trained, predictions are made for all examples in the dataset, and the input rows and predicted class value for the first five examples are printed and compared to the expected class value. You can see that most rows are correctly predicted. In fact, you can expect about 77% of the rows to be correctly predicted based on your estimated performance of the model in the previous section."
