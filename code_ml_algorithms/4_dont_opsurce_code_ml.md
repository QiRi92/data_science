# Donâ€™t Start with Open-Source Code When Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/edward-raff/40/920/99">Edward Raff</a> is the author of the Java Machine Learning library called <a href="https://code.google.com/p/java-statistical-analysis-tool/">JSAT</a> (which is an acronym for Java Statistical Analysis Tool).

Edward has implemented many algorithms in creating this library and I recently reached out to him and asked what advice he could give to beginners implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.

In this post we take a look at tips on implementing machine learning algorithms based on Edwards advice.
