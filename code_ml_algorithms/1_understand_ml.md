# Understand Machine Learning Algorithms By Implementing Them From Scratch

Implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch seems like a great way for a programmer to understand machine learning.

And maybe it is.

But there some downsides to this approach too.

In this post you will discover some great resources that you can use to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.

You will also discover some of the limitations of this seemingly perfect approach.

## Benefits of Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

I promote the idea of implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.

I think you can learn a lot about how algorithms work. I also think that as a developer, it provides a bridge into learning the mathematical notations, descriptions and intuitions used in machine learning.

In the post I listed the benefits as:

1. the understanding you gain
2. the starting point it provides
3. the ownership of the algorithm and code it forces

I’ve helped a lot of programmers get started in machine learning over the last few years. From my experience, I list 5 of the most common stumbling blocks that I see tripping up programmers and the tactics that you can use to over come them.

Finally, you will discover 3 quick tips to getting the most from code tutorials and going from a copy-paste programmer (if you happen to be one) to truly diving down the rabbit hole of machine learning algorithms.

## Great Books You Can Use To Implement Algorithms

I have implemented a lot of algorithms from scratch, directly from research papers. It can be very difficult.

It is a much gentler start to follow someone else’s tutorial.

There are many excellent resources that you can use to get started implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.
