    "The topic surrounding the Random Forest algorithm has already been explained well in these tutorials by Jason Brownlee [1, 2], but let’s first start with brushing up on some of the most important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm called *bagging*. It is a popular variation of *bagged decision trees*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A decision tree is a branched model that consists of a hierarchy of decision nodes, where each decision node splits the data based on a decision rule. Training a decision tree involves a greedy selection of the best split points (i.e., points that divide the input space best) by minimizing a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The greedy approach through which decision trees construct their decision boundaries makes them susceptible to high variance. This means that small changes in the training dataset can lead to very different tree structures and, in turn, model predictions. If the decision tree is not pruned, it will also tend to capture noise and outliers in the training data. This sensitivity to the training data makes decision trees susceptible to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Bagged decision trees* address this susceptibility by combining the predictions from multiple decision trees, each trained on a bootstrap sample of the training dataset created by sampling the dataset with replacement. The limitation of this approach stems from the fact that the same greedy approach trains each tree, and some samples may be picked several times during training, making it very possible that the trees share similar (or the same) split points (hence, resulting in correlated trees). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Random Forest algorithm tries to mitigate this correlation by training each tree on a random subset of the training data, created by randomly sampling the dataset without replacement. In this manner, the greedy algorithm can only consider a fixed subset of the data to create the split points that make up each tree, which forces the trees to be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the case of a classification problem, every tree in the forest produces a prediction output, and the final class label is identified as the output that the majority of the trees have produced. In the case of regression, the final output is the average of the outputs produced by all the trees."
