    "The HOG is a feature extraction technique that aims to represent the local shape and appearance of objects inside the image space by a distribution of their edge directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the HOG technique performs the following steps when applied to an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computes the image gradients in horizontal and vertical directions using, for example, a Prewitt operator. The magnitude and direction of the gradient are then computed for every pixel in the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Divide the image into non-overlapping cells of fixed size and compute a histogram of gradients for each cell. This histogram representation of every image cell is more compact and more robust to noise. The cell size is typically set according to the size of the image features we want to capture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concatenates the histograms over blocks of cells into one-dimensional feature vectors and normalizes them. This makes the descriptor more robust to lighting variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, it concatenates all normalized feature vectors representing the blocks of cells to obtain a final feature vector representation of the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HOG implementation in OpenCV takes several input arguments that correspond to the aforementioned steps, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The window size (*winSize*) that corresponds to the minimum object size to be detected. \n",
    "- The cell size (*cellSize*) typically captures the size of the image features of interest. \n",
    "- The block size (*blockSize*) tackles the problem of variation in illumination. \n",
    "- The block stride (*blockStride*) controls how much neighboring blocks overlap. \n",
    "- The number of histogram bins (*nbins*) to capture gradients between 0 and 180 degrees.\n",

    "Based on our choice of parameter values, we may see that the HOG technique returns feature vectors of size 1X81 for each image. This means each image is now represented by points in an 81-dimensional space. The BoW technique, on the other hand, returns vectors of size 1X50 for each image, where the vector length has been determined by the number of k-means clusters of choice, which is also analogous to the vocabulary size.  \n",

    "Hence, we may see that, instead of simply flattening out each image into a one-dimensional vector, we have managed to represent each image more compactly by applying the HOG and BoW techniques. \n",
