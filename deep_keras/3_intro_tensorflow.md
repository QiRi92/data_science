# Introduction to the Python Deep Learning Library TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google.

It is a foundation library that can be used to create Deep Learning models directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the process built on top of TensorFlow.

## What Is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source library for fast numerical computing.

It was created and is maintained by Google and was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. The API is nominally for the Python programming language, although there is access to the underlying C++ API.

Unlike other numerical libraries intended for use in Deep Learning like Theano, TensorFlow was designed for use both in research and development and in production systems, not least of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RankBrain">RankBrain in Google search</a> and the fun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream">DeepDream project</a>.

It can run on single CPU systems and GPUs, as well as mobile devices and large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines.
